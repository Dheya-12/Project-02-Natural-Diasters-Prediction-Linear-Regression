# Project-02-Natural-Diasters-Prediction-Linear-Regression

This project uses disaster data to predict the number of deaths caused by various natural disasters based on the type of disaster and year. The solution leverages machine learning with a Linear Regression model and provides an interactive Gradio interface for predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding disaster types.
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Machine learning pipeline with log transformation for better prediction accuracy.
- Interactive prediction interface using **Gradio**.
- Model persistence using `pickle` for later reuse.
